# HallÃ¶chen ðŸ‘‹
I'm Tom, a 19-year-old self-taught programmer from Germany. I started coding in late 2021, and since then, I've been on an exciting journey of continuous learning and growth.

With a strong grasp of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I can create dynamic and visually appealing web applications, but my strength is in coding and logic. You can trace my progress through the commit history on GitHub, where I showcase my solo projects.

In addition to web development, I have experience in Python, LaTex, IT security, and networking, enhancing my versatility in the tech landscape.

Beyond programming, I'm a skilled craftsman. From gardening to woodworking, metalwork to knitting and sewing, and even bricklaying. Additionally, I bring discipline and a competitive spirit from my past as a mountain bike downhill racer.Â 

Currently,Â I'm a dedicated gym rat and attendÂ a media design school.
